# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 24, 2019
#(delete me or comment me out)

**Plans for Today**: 
Work on a Django downloader app
1. Read the existing code
2. Create a Django app (module) in which admin can upload different kind of files and users can download the files.
* Start an app, add it to settings.
* Make a model Uploader.
* Make a list view.
* Create a template list view.
* Add an url.

**Today's Progress**: 
I managed to start an Uploader app in Django. It's a part of a bigger project. I created a Document Model and registered it in admin.py and now I can upload documents as an admin. I also created a template (HTML page) where a list of all uploaded documents is supposed to be display. 

**Thoughts:** 
I managed to do the simplest part of the project. The list of documents doesn't show any documents:-(

**Plans for tomorrow**:
Find out how to display description / title of the uploaded file as an active link for download. 
1. Display the titles of the uploaded files.
2. Learn how a downloader works.
