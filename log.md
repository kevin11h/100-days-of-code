# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 24, 2019
#(delete me or comment me out)

**Plans for Today**:
Work on a Django downloader app
1. Read the existing code
2. Create a Django app (module) in which admin can upload different kind of files and users can download the files.
* Start an app, add it to settings.
* Make a model Uploader.
* Make a list view.
* Create a template list view.
* Add an url.

**Today's Progress**:
I managed to start an Uploader app in Django. It's a part of a bigger project. I created a Document Model and registered it in admin.py and now I can upload documents as an admin. I also created a template (HTML page) where a list of all uploaded documents is supposed to be display.

**Thoughts:**
I managed to do the simplest part of the project. The list of documents doesn't show any documents:-(

**Plans for tomorrow**:
Find out how to display description / title of the uploaded file as an active link for download.
1. Display the titles of the uploaded files.
2. Learn how a downloader works.

### Day 2: April 25, 2019
**Plans for Today**:
1. Create local copy of 100DaysOfCode repository.
2. Read about working with files in Python.
3. Watch videos about uploading and downloading files in Django.

**Today's Progress**:
1. Local copy of 100DaysOfCode - done.
2. & 3. I read about working with files and start watching a few videos but they
very mostly about uploading files or creating files.
Unfortunately I have a problem with migrations. I had to remove part of the database
and migrations files. And now I need time to fix migrations.

**Thoughts:** I found it difficult to concentrate on the project due to my work
problems. I also need to spend more time learning Python to be able to build things
from scratch without looking for everything online.

**Plans for tomorrow**:
1. Read carefully git rep with manga_download
2. Fix the migrations
3. Write path to file (function)
4. Write view to download files.
